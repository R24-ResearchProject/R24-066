### Collaborating with MAS Linea Aqua, Hanwella, Sri Lanka.

#### Research Problem Definition: üîç
<p align='justify'>In the modern world, one of the largest product production industries is garment manufacturing. One of the top swimsuit manufacturers, MAS Linea Aqua, handles a lot of orders both domestically and abroad every day. Since their Research & Development department is still working on this project, their primary goal is to increase productivity while maintaining the highest level of accuracy and efficiency. We were tasked with creating a stand-alone tool for production floor real-time quality monitoring. They currently use a manual system to check quality; this system needs to be automated and provide real-time feedback. While it has been possible in recent years to record the live sewing process of a garment and to record the seams to identify problems, the majority of these recordings are not made in real-time, and real-time quality monitoring systems exist in other industries but not in the apparel sector.</p>
